Work with geotifs to detect charcoal hearths

Geotifs images are searched for objects resembling charcoal hearths.
To prepare of searching, download the files and split them into uniform sized rectangles.

Download geotifs from shared drive: 
All Data from Weston\LAS_Files\Part_[1-4]\[Area 52]QGISDEM\

To:
/storage/images/part_[1-4]/
example:
/storage/images/part_1/51blast2demPAS_Slope_DEM.tif

Run 0_1_check_that_all_DEM_Slope_tif_are_downloaded to verify all files are downloaded and to prepare to split them into rectangles.

In QGIS run
qgis_4_check_we_have_all_layers.py
This will check the files against a list of State Game Lands from Wikipedia. (An extra check)
